ASyncMouse
==========

ASyncMouse is a plugin which moves the mouse on another thread so your script
can update the mouse destination while the mouse is actively moving.

The following methods are defined:

.. code-block:: pascal



  procedure TASyncMouse.Move(Destination: TPoint; Accuracy: Double = 1);
  procedure TASyncMouse.ChangeDestination(Destination: TPoint);
  procedure TASyncMouse.Stop;
  function TASyncMouse.IsMoving: Boolean;

**Example :**

.. code-block:: pascal


  {$I SRL/OSR.simba}
  {$I SRL/utils/asyncmouse.simba}

  function FindMyObject(out Position: TPoint): Boolean;
  begin
    // Your object finder ..
  end;

  var
    Position: TPoint;

  begin
    if FindMyObject(Position) then
    begin
      ASyncMouse.Move(Position);

      while ASyncMouse.IsMoving() do
      begin
        if FindMyObject(Position) then
          ASyncMouse.ChangeDestination(Position);

        Wait(50);
      end;
    end;
  end.

* *Accuracy* parameter in *ASyncMouse.Move* is maximum distance to the destination where the
  mouse movement is considered finished. By default it's *1* which means the mouse wont
  stop moving until the exact destination has been reached.

* ASyncMouse uses the current variables (Speed, Wind, Gravity) from SRL's *Mouse* variable.

* Mouse movement can be stopped at anytime with *ASyncMouse.Stop*
