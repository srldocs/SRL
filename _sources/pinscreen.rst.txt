PinScreen
==========
This file stores all methods that are used in the pinscreen-iterface.

Technically, I think you can call `PinScreen.EnterPin` to determine if the
bankscreen interface is open, by doing so it would enter the pin if there is one.

I think at some point this should probably be handled automatically by bankscreen
looking at the code this will be a bit troublesome now? - slacky

.. code-block:: pascal


    WriteLn(PinScreen.EnterPin()); // returns True if we got to the bank or GE
